# Alexa-like Chatbot

This Python project contains a chatbot that simulates an interaction with Alexa using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The user can speak to the bot via their microphone, and the bot will convert the audio to text using the SpeechRecognition library. The bot then uses GPT-3 to generate a response to the user's message and converts it to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library. Finally, the bot plays the audio response using the playsound library.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- openai
- speech_recognition
- datetime
- gtts
- playsound

The project also requires an OpenAI API key, which should be stored in a file called 'openai_api_key.txt' in the project's root directory.

## Running the Chatbot
To run the chatbot, simply run the run_alexa() function from the command line. The chatbot will prompt the user to ask a question or provide a command, and will respond with an appropriate answer or action. To stop the chatbot, the user can say "stop" or simply close the command line.

## Customizing the Chatbot
The chatbot can be customized by modifying the gpt3_chat() function. This function sends the user's message to OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and receives a response. The response can be modified by changing the GPT-3 prompt, engine, temperature, and other parameters. The talk() function can also be customized to change the speech language or voice.

Note: this README file was generated by GPT.
